Writing3D
=========
Writing3D is a set of tools designed to lower the barrier-of-entry (and speed
up development time) for producing VR games, literature, and artwork. Click
`here <https://wphicks.github.io/Writing3D/>`_ to view the complete
documentation website.

Quickstart Guide
----------------
The easiest way to get started with Writing3D is to download a zipfile install
from one of the following locations:

* `Linux <https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B-L9I5ef3FLWY0s1WHJQbk15Zmc>`_
* `Windows <https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B-L9I5ef3FLWNzFlOWd1dmh1aDQ>`_
* `Mac <https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B-L9I5ef3FLWRGttR1U2WmFBaE0>`_

Note that this includes the old (non-FOSS, Java-based) cwapp editor and a copy
of the appropriate version of Blender. Unzip the archive to any convenient
location. You can then launch CWEditor.jar with Java to begin creating
Writing3D projects.

.. Warning::
    The first time you open CWEditor.jar, you may need to open the Run menu,
    select "Configure Paths" and then simply click "OK" to get CWEditor to
    recognize the Writing3D backend.

Samples
^^^^^^^
After installing, try opening up any xml file in the ``Writing3D/samples/xml_samples``
directory from within CWEditor. If you then click "Desktop Preview" at the
bottom of the page, the sample should run. If it does not, please
:ref:`contact` us.

For Developers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
For developers or those who prefer to work from the command line, check out the
:ref:`developer_guide` for install information.
