Getting Involved
================

Writing3D is currently a volunteer effort by a single programmer, William
Hicks. He is very grateful for the support and encouragement of the Brown
University VR community, but he would love to see more people get directly
involved with Writing3D to make it a viable platform as soon as possible.
Please feel free to reach out to him through Twitter (`@whimsicalilk
<https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?screen_name=whimsicalilk>`_).  with
questions, comments, suggestions, etc. Here are some other ways you can help
make Writing3D a reality (and then make it better!):

For Python Coders
-----------------
If you're interested in contributing code to Writing3D, please check out the
:ref:`developer_guide`. You might also take a look at the `issue tracker
<https://github.com/wphicks/Writing3D/issues>`_, particularly issues marked
``beginner-friendly``.

For Non-Coders
--------------
The absolute most helpful thing you can do is to use Writing3D on your
awesome project (whatever it is) and `submit an issue
<https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-issue/>`_ on `Github
<https://github.com/wphicks/Writing3D/issues>`_ whenever you notice something
that is wrong or confusing. Please note what operating system you are using and
we'll take it from there.

You can also contribute by helping write documentation and create samples for
the project. If you want to clarify or add onto this documentation, or if you
have a small sample that you think would be useful for other users to look at,
either:

1. `Fork <https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/>`_ Writing3D on `Github
   <https://github.com/wphicks/Writing3D>`_ and `send us a pull request
   <https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/>`_ or 
2. Tweet `@whimsicalilk
   <https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?screen_name=whimsicalilk>`_, and we'll help
   you add your changes to the project.

For those wishing to donate
---------------------------
At the moment, we do not have a system in place for you to donate money to the
development effort, but we do strongly encourage you to consider donating to
the open source projects on which Writing3D depends, including `BlenderVR
<https://blendervr.limsi.fr/doku.php>`_, `Blender
<https://www.blender.org/foundation/donation-payment/>`_, and `Python
<https://www.python.org/psf/donations/>`_. Without these projects, Writing3D
(and a lot of other great programs) could not exist.

While we don't currently accept donations, we *are* on the lookout for grants
to help speed the development of this project. If you're aware of a
grant-giving organization that might be interested in Writing3D, we'd love to
hear about it.
